# Daily Task Submission Repository

Welcome to the Daily Task Submission Repository. To maintain organization and consistency, please follow the structure outlined below when submitting your daily tasks.

## Repository Structure

The repository structure should be as follows:



Here's a breakdown of the structure:

- `UNDER_MAIN_REPO`: This is the main directory of the repository.
    - `your_name`: Create a directory with your name or username to keep your submissions separate.
      Within your directory, create a subdirectory for each daily task.
        - `task_1`, 
          `task_2`,
        - Place all files related to a specific task inside its corresponding subdirectory.

By adhering to this structure, we can easily track and review your daily task submissions. Thank you for your cooperation!
